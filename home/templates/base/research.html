                        <p>Starting in 2012 I have served as the director for the <a href="http://paleocore.org">PaleoCore Project</a>.
                            PaleoCore is an NSF funded informatics initiative to 1) develop data standards for paleoanthropology, 2) tools
                            for digitial data collection and 3) a repository for collaboratively storing and managing data
                            by research teams and museums. The future of paleoanthropology as a science requires a transition towards greater integration
                            and synthesis of data across multiple domains of expertise (e.g. geology, paleontology, climatology)
                            and across multiple research teams working in different geographic areas. Accomplishing this requires
                            we develop standards to consolidate how we collect and represent data as well as better
                            tools for collaboratively collecting and manging data in the field and in the lab (Reed et al. 2015).
                            PaleoCore also serves as the primary data repository and data management infrastructure
                            for the <a href="http://arvrc.blogspot.com/?zx=492c3c0b40a66d47">

                    <p> I have been working in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afar_Region">Afar region of Ethiopia</a> since 2002, first at the site of
                        <a href="http://paleocore.org/projects/drp/">Dikika</a>
                        more recently at our new site, <a href="http://paleocore.org/projects/mlp/">Mille-Logya</a>. Dikika became famous for the discovery of
                        'Selam', (Alemseged et al., 2006) a juvenile skeleton of <em><a href="http://efossils.org/species/australopithecus-afarensis">Australopithecus
                            afarensis</a></em>, the same species as the well-known <a href="http://efossils.org/page/boneviewer/Australopithecus%20afarensis/AL%20288-1">'Lucy'</a> skeleton from across the
                        Awash River at the site of <a href="">Hadar</a>.  Selam is remarkable for preserving
                        delicate parts of the skeleton that do not normally survive the fossilization process, such as
                        the complete skull, scapula, hyoid, ribs, and articulated vertebrae. It is also remarkable for
                        being a juvenile individual, probably less than three yeears old, when she died.

                    <p> For my dissertation (Reed, 2003) I lived 18 months in the Serengeti National Park (mid 1998 - 2000)
                        in northern Tanzania conducting research on the structure of woodland and grassland
                        ecosystem and how they influence the distribution of mammal communities there, especially
                        small mammals such as rodents and insectivores.  To quickly assess the
                        patterns of biodiversity in Serengeti, I collected dense bone assemblages from owl roosts and
                        identified the remains. Owls are avid predators of small mammals and routinely digest the entirety of their prey,
                        then regurgitate the bones, fur and other hard parts in a compact pellet. Over time these pellets
                        accumulate beneath the nesting and roosting sites of owls and provide an excellent (and rapid)
                        measure of local biodiversity (usually what lives withing 1 km of the roost or nest) (Reed, 2005).  The data on
                        small mammal community patterns provides the necessary baseline data for interpreting community composition
                        in fossil assemblages. By studying the dynamics of modern ecosystems from the perspective of palenotology we
                        can strengthen in inferences we make about the past from fossil assemblages (Reed, 2011). This type of work
                        is often referred to as middle-range research, research that links modern processes to traces from the past.

                      	<p>A large component of my dissertation research (Reed, 2003) included spatial analysis (GIS) of
                            environmental gradients in the Serengeti ecosystem and their influence on vegetation
                            structure and the related effects on mammalian species distributions. Teaming up with several
                            scientists working in Serengeti, we produced a comprehensive
                            <a href="data/sermarveg_30m_l2r.zip">vegetation map of the ecosystem</a>
                            from Landsat satellite imagery (Reed et al. 2009). The study of modern savanna
                            ecosystems plays a critical role in understanding paleoenvironments and the ecological
                            context of human evolution.  This research is also important for understanding the impacts of
                            global climate change, and for effective management and conservation in the Serengeti.

                        components of ecosystems (Miller et al. 2014). Currently I'm working with a graduate student on
                        assessing what the effects and differences are between assemblages created by avian predators
